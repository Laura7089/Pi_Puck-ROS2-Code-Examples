# Pi_Puck-ROS2-Code-Examples
This repository is intended for educational use. 
Containing information of Pi-Puck simulation and ROS2 examples.
## Introduction
The Pi-puck is a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org) extension board for the [e-puck](http://www.gctronic.com/doc/index.php?title=E-Puck) and [e-puck2](http://www.gctronic.com/doc/index.php?title=e-puck2) robot platforms, designed and built as a collaboration between the [University of York](https://www.york.ac.uk/robot-lab/) and [GCtronic](http://www.gctronic.com).

[Webots](https://cyberbotics.com/) is an open source, professional mobile robot simulation software package. It can be used for a variety of applications.
I used it for rapid prototyping and carrying out swarm experiments.

This repository is a set of code examples and useful links to other ROS2 code.
